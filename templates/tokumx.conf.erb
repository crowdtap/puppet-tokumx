# Use direct I/O to access data on disk, bypassing the kernel page
# cache.  When using direct I/O, it is usually good to set cacheSize
# higher (around 80% of physical memory).  Out-of-memory workloads
# typically perform better with direct I/O on and a larger cacheSize.

# Flush the recovery log every logFlushPeriod milliseconds (similar to
# journalCommitInterval in vanilla mongodb).  Unlike vanilla mongodb,
# logFlushPeriod=0 means flush after every operation commit, which can

# values are 0-300ms, default is 100ms.
